A story treatment is a long-form summary of your story. It\'92s very similar to a short story, but it doesn\'92t always require quite as much detail. When preparing a treatment, create a one-line summary of each scene in your story. Then choose the most important action sequences and use them to summarize your script. Intersperse a few lines of dialogue from important scenes for dramatic emphasis. Make sure your treatment describes the main line of action, the protagonist, his love interest/confidant, and the antagonist. These are the primary elements of every successful story.}
